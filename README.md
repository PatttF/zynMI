# Mutable Instruments LV2 Plugins

ARM64(for Zynthian) and Linux x86-64 LV2 plugins featuring Plaits and Braids macro oscillators with Rings resonator, 7 filter types, and Marbles random generator.

## Building

```bash
# Build all plugins for both x86_64 (testing) and aarch64 (Zynthian)
make all

# Build for specific architecture
make x86_64    # Native testing
make aarch64   # Zynthian ARM64

# Build individual plugins
make plaits
make braids
make marbles

# Verify bundles
make verify

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Deployment to Zynthian

```bash
# Deploy to Zynthian
scp -r aarch64-build/*.lv2 root@zynthian.local:/zynthian/zynthian-plugins/lv2/

# Or use the shortcut
make install  # Shows the deploy command
```
